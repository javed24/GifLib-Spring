## GifLib-Spring

This Spring application works as an animated gif library. Users will be able to view gifs based on their assigned categories. The `Explore` option shows all the uploaded gifs and the `Categories` option shows the gifs depending on their categories. This project is part of [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com)'s Spring course.
